    <h1>Bilal Khan</h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
    <p>I was most recently an intern at Nvidia working on performance engineering for the <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch">PyTorch</a> core library. Before that, I worked on training stability, scaling laws, and efficiency for mixture-of-experts language models (萌えs) on the pretraining team at <a href="https://www.databricks.com/research/mosaic">Databricks/MosaicML</a>. Previously, I was a student researcher at <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google Brain</a> on the algorithmic efficiency team (machine learning optimizers and training efficiency) hosted by <a href="http://zna.do">Zachary Nado</a>. Before that, I spent two amazing internships as an early engineer at <a href="https://cohere.ai">Co:here</a> where I wrote TensorFlow and JAX to scale the training of LLMs to exaflop-scale TPU clusters and lead development of a new LLM inference runtime to serve our first O(50B) LLM to users. In my free time you can probably find me working, travelling, skiing, cooking, eating, or playing Factorio/League/Valorant.</p>
